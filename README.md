# Skyway Demo Dash

## Description

Skyway Demo Dash is a web application prototype designed to demonstrate core functionalities of a Customer Portal for drone fleet management and an Admin Portal for auditing fleet data. This project serves as a scaled-down version of a potential full-scale application, showcasing essential features and a user-friendly interface built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- **Customer Portal**: Allows customers to manage their drone fleets, including adding new fleets, assigning drones to fleets, and removing drones or fleets as needed.
- **Admin Portal**: Provides administrative access to oversee and audit all fleet data, with functionalities tailored for administrative control.

## Admin Access

To access the Admin Portal, use the following credentials:

- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `password`

_Note: These credentials are for demonstration purposes only and should not be used in a production environment._
